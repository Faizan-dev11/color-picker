Color Picker Webpage 

This is a simple Color Picker webpage built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
When the "Change Color" button is clicked, the program randomly selects a color from a predefined list and:

Changes the background to the selected color
Displays the colorâ€™s name on the screen

This project was created as a practice exercise to improve my skills in:
DOM manipulation with JavaScript
Event handling
Styling with CSS
